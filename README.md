# Airport Application
This application was built following the 'Up and Running with AngularJS' tutorial on lynda.com by Joseph LeBlanc.


## Installation

To get the server up and running:

* Install [Node](http://nodejs.org).
* Key `npm install` the first time to get the server's dependencies.
* Key `node index.js` to start the server.
* Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The port number can be changed in `index.js` if necessary.

## Objectives

# Learn how to use scoped controllers to bind data to markup, while keeping your JavaScript decoupled and reusable. 
# Use filters to handle the final visual output of your data, without cluttering the rest of your codebase. 
# Route requests through AngularJS rather than making a round trip to the server. Load and modify server data using custom services. 
#Plus, find tools designed to work with AngularJS and learn about ways you can extend it to suit your needs.
